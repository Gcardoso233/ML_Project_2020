# Machine Learning Project 2020/2021 - Tax Payer Classification / Prediction

As MSc Students in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at Nova Information Managment School, we were asked to develop machine learning methods suitable for
predicting income from the proposed dataset using supervised machine learning algorithms: 
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Boosting
- Ada Boost algorithm
And compare their performances to obtain the best performing classifier and then use Stacking to increasing the predictive force of the classifier.

The result is that the best model is Gradient Boosting with average F1 Score of 86.96% using 10-fold cross-validation over 22,400 observations in the training dataset.
